  I am a student at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science, and quite frankly, I am in love with the Metaverse.
  <br><br>
  Aside from my journey of pursuing my education, I am currently in works of a [VERY TOP SECRET] project and I have high hopes of a late 2022 to early 2023 release.
